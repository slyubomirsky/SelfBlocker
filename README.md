This is a really dumb Chrome extension I wrote because I
could not find anything on the web store that did what I wanted.

You can specify rules to block certain websites on specific
days of the week. There is no more granularity than this
bacause that is all I personally wanted.

If a URL rule (i.e., just URLs with wildcards permitted)
matches a tab you open, that tab will be closed unless it is
a day of the week on which it is permitted.

Use at your own peril. I assert no rights whatsoever
and implore you to modify this code as you wish if
you need more or better functionality.
